# RyuCHALK

A complete backup of ryusak web on May 9 2023, to use with modified ryusak source, without trash like raspberry software, ps5 firmware updates or blade and soul pc game. Json archives to work full web with modified builded executable. You can run ryusak full offline or host your own, and make public or just share with your small community or your friends, that is RyuCHALK it's like those Chinese games you could buy in the 90s, but in 2023, it's a clone of the original, but without those limitations that make you don't need to get any other solution when the service doesn't work.

#About data

#Special thanks

Thanks to Ecchibitionist for being a choppy guy and threatening to just turn the service down because he thinks most of us are pricks.
